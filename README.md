# Virtual-BioLab (If you not practice what you learn, you will learn nothing).


## About

<p> Virtual Lab is a free, online educational resource provided for educational purposes. Virtual Lab simulates natural environments with the way life responds to changing conditions. We provide a world to be explored rather than a path to be followed. Background information and technical instruction help students learn by experimentation.</p>
